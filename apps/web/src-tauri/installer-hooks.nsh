; Sketchor Explorer shell extension -- NSIS installer hooks.
; -----------------------------------------------------------
; The .dxf / .step / .iges thumbnail handler is a COM in-proc server
; (shell-ext\dxf_thumbnailer.dll, staged by native/build-shell-extensions.ps1
; and bundled as a resource). These hooks register it at install time and
; unregister it at uninstall time, so users never have to run
; native/dxf-thumbnailer/install*.ps1 themselves.
;
; regsvr32 calls the DLL's DllRegisterServer, which writes its keys under
; HKCU\Software\Classes -- succeeds without elevation for a per-user install.
;
; The DLL is 64-bit, so it MUST be registered by the 64-bit regsvr32:
; the NSIS installer stub is 32-bit, so on x64 Windows we disable WOW64 file
; redirection first, otherwise $SYSDIR\regsvr32.exe would launch the 32-bit
; regsvr32 and land the COM registration in the Wow6432Node view that 64-bit
; Explorer never reads.
;
; Two things learned the hard way (0.14.2):
;
; 1. Explorer keeps the DLL mapped once it has drawn a thumbnail, so an
;    update cannot overwrite it -- the installer silently kept the old file
;    and re-registered *that*. A mapped DLL can still be RENAMED, so the
;    pre-install hook parks the old one as .old (deleted on reboot) and the
;    fresh copy lands at the real name. Explorer picks it up once it drops
;    the idle old module (DllCanUnloadNow) or at the next sign-in.
;
; 2. Windows 11 Explorer only consults a thumbnail handler for an extension
;    if HKLM\Software\Classes\<ext>\ShellEx\{E357FCCD-...} exists -- even
;    though the handler and the value it resolves to may live in HKCU. A
;    per-user installer can't write HKLM, so the post-install hook asks for
;    elevation ONCE (a UAC prompt) to create those keys; declining just
;    leaves Explorer showing icons. Silent installs -- the in-app updater --
;    never prompt; the app asks at its next launch instead (on by default,
;    see desktop/explorerPreviews.ts and `enable_explorer_previews`).
