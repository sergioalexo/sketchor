 * Manifests for the in-repo first-party plugins. In Phase 1 a "builtin" was just
 * an id the worker could import; Phase 2 gives each a real {@link PluginManifest}
 * — the same shape a third-party plugin ships — so the host registers its
 * `contributes` block through the ordinary path. Third-party manifests loaded
 * from disk/registry (Phase 4/5) flow through the exact same registration.
 *
 * `engines.sketchor` is pinned to the current host API version so these exercise
 * the load-time compatibility check like any real plugin would.
