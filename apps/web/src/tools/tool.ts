/**
 * The tool framework (roadmap T-00). A tool is a small state machine —
 * prompt → pick → pick → commit — that lives in its own file, keeps its
 * own in-progress state, and talks to the drawing only through Commands.
 * The viewport owns input decoding (snapping, tracking, touch vs mouse,
 * typed coordinates) and hands the tool finished picks; it also asks the
 * tool what to draw as a preview and what to say in the status bar.
 *
 * Rules for every tool (also in CLAUDE.md):
 *  1. Geometry math is a pure function in @sketchor/core with a test. The
 *     tool only collects picks and calls it.
 *  2. The tool emits Command values through `ctx.execute`/`ctx.commit` —
 *     never mutates entities.
 *  3. `cancel` must leave the tool idle; Esc calls it before anything else.
 *
 * Tools not yet migrated (select, measure, text, image, fill, straighten,
 * dim, pan) still live as cases inside Viewport.tsx; `getTool` returns
 * null for those and the viewport takes its legacy path.
