 * the side the user clicked. Lines shift sideways, circles and arcs
 * become concentric, and a polyline is offset leg by leg and re-joined:
 * neighbouring offset legs are extended or trimmed to their intersection
 * (AutoCAD's default `OFFSETGAPTYPE=0`), and where two offset legs no
 * longer reach each other (the outside of a convex corner between arcs)
 * a round join around the original vertex fills the gap. Legs that turn
 * inside out — a short edge on the inner offset of a closed outline — are
 * dropped and their neighbours re-joined, which is what makes the inner
 * offset of a real part outline come out clean instead of looped.
 *
 * Everything is expressed as a signed distance: positive offsets to the
 * left of the direction of travel. `sideSign` turns a click into that sign.
