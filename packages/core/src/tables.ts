 * model: an entity *refers* to a record by name (`layer: "WALLS"`), and the
 * record is the one place its properties live.
 *
 * Records are plain JSON (`name` plus whatever the owning feature defines), so
 * they serialise, diff and undo like everything else; later items (B-01 blocks,
 * D-03 dim styles, H-06 patterns, L-01 layouts, T-45 parameters) narrow the
 * shape of their own table. Tables change only through the
 * `put-table-record` / `delete-table-record` / `rename-table-record` commands.
