/**
 * Z-04: named linetypes — DXF's `LTYPE` table, authored clean-room from the
 * ISO 128 line-type descriptions (long dash / short dash / dot proportions),
 * not copied from any vendor's `.lin` file. `pattern` is in millimetres at
 * `$LTSCALE` = 1, alternating dash (positive, pen down) and gap (negative,
 * pen up) — the DXF group-49 convention — with `0` standing for a dot (DXF
 * draws a dot as a zero-length dash). `[]` means solid/continuous.
 *
 * Only these nine ship built in; anything else (a `.lin` import — not yet
 * built, see the roadmap) becomes a record in the document's `linetypes`
 * table instead of a entry here.
