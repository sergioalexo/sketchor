 * Constraints are equations (see residuals.ts) and the sketch's numbers
 * are the unknowns (see model.ts); solving is least squares by
 * Levenberg–Marquardt, which is the standard choice for this shape of
 * problem: it behaves like Gauss–Newton near a solution, where it
 * converges in a handful of iterations, and like gradient descent far
 * from one, where Gauss–Newton would fly off. Sketches have tens of
 * unknowns, so dense linear algebra is not worth avoiding.
 *
 * The public face is {@link solveSketch}: hand it the document's entities
 * and constraints, get back the entities that moved, the remaining
 * degrees of freedom, and the constraints it could not satisfy. It is
 * deliberately a pure function over plain data so it can run anywhere —
 * on the bus after a command, inside a drag, or one day in a worker —
 * and so that a different engine could be dropped in behind it.
