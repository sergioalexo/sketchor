 * outer profile (so a part can't shift or fall before its own internal
 * features are cut), a part nested inside another part's hole cut
 * completely before that hole is cut (or the disc of material around it
 * comes loose first), kerf baked into the path itself (not G41/G42, so any
 * controller works), and a short lead-in that pierces off the true edge and
 * cuts onto it, rather than piercing on the line and leaving a mark.
 *
 * Deliberately out of scope for this pass: arc lead-ins (only the plan's
 * "line" option is built; a straight edge is what's picked first anyway),
 * and a true global travelling-salesman order (the nearest-neighbour walk
 * here is the same class of heuristic `nestTrueShape` itself uses — good
 * enough to not wander the sheet, not claimed optimal).
