.SYNOPSIS
  Builds and registers the Sketchor DXF thumbnail provider so Windows
  Explorer shows previews for .dxf files.

.DESCRIPTION
  1. Builds the crate in release mode (needs the Rust MSVC toolchain).
  2. Copies the DLL to a stable per-user location (registration records
     the DLL path, so it must not move afterwards).
  3. Registers it with regsvr32. The provider writes to HKCU\Software\Classes,
     so no administrator rights are required for a per-user install.
  4. Clears the Explorer thumbnail cache and restarts Explorer so the new
     previews appear.

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
  Register the already-built DLL without rebuilding.

.PARAMETER NoRestart
  Do not clear the cache / restart Explorer (do it yourself later).
